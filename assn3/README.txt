The Lucene Directory contains my best working attempt at getting Lucene functioning on my Windows 10 computer.

IndexFiles.java and SearchFiles.java were the default java files provided to us at the beginning of the semester when he insisted we set up lucene. In order to run IndexFiles through eclipse, one need to go to run and change the args to be "-docs gutenberg-corpus\"

THESE FILES ARE NOT PERTINENT TO THE ASSIGNMENT, AND FUNCTION ONLY AS A FIRST TEST OF LUCENE FUNCTIONALITY ON YOUR SYSTEM.

DocumentIndexing.java, ExplainScoring.java, and BasicSearch.java are the sample files provided by Dr. Gudivada.
